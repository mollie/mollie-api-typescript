# CreateSalesInvoiceStatusResponse

The status for the invoice to end up in.

A `draft` invoice is not paid or not sent and can be updated after creation. Setting it to `issued` sends it to
the recipient so they may then pay through our payment system. To skip our payment process, set this to `paid` to
mark it as paid. It can then subsequently be sent as well, same as with `issued`.

A status value that cannot be set but can be returned is `canceled`, for invoices which were
issued, but then canceled. Currently this can only be done for invoices created in the dashboard.

Dependent parameters:
  - `paymentDetails` is required if invoice should be set directly to `paid`
  - `customerId` and `mandateId` are required if a recurring payment should be used to set the invoice to `paid`
  - `emailDetails` optional for `issued` and `paid` to send the invoice by email

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { CreateSalesInvoiceStatusResponse } from "mollie-api-typescript/models/operations";

let value: CreateSalesInvoiceStatusResponse = "draft";
```

## Values

```typescript
"draft" | "issued" | "paid"
```
