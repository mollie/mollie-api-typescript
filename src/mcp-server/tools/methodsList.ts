  description: `List payment methods

Retrieve all enabled payment methods. The results of this endpoint are
**not** paginated â€” unlike most other list endpoints in our API.

For test mode, all pending and enabled payment methods are returned. If no
payment methods are requested yet, the most popular payment methods are returned in the test mode. For live
mode, only fully enabled payment methods are returned.

Payment methods can be requested and enabled via the Mollie Dashboard, or
via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API.

The list can optionally be filtered using a number of parameters described
below.

By default, only payment methods for the Euro currency are returned. If you
wish to retrieve payment methods which exclusively support other currencies (e.g. Twint), you need to use the
\`amount\` parameters.`,
