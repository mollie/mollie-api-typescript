Depending on the payment method, you may be able to cancel a payment for a certain amount of time — usually until
the next business day or as long as the payment status is open.

Payments may also be canceled manually from the Mollie Dashboard.

The \`isCancelable\` property on the [Payment object](get-payment) will indicate if the payment can be canceled.`,
