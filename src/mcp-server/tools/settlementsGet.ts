Retrieve a single settlement by its ID.

To lookup settlements by their bank reference, replace the ID in the URL by
a reference. For example: \`1234567.2404.03\`.

A settlement represents a transfer of your balance funds to your external bank account.

Settlements will typically include a report that details what balance transactions have taken place between this
settlement and the previous one.

For more accurate bookkeeping, refer to the [balance report](get-balance-report) endpoint or the
[balance transactions](list-balance-transactions) endpoint.`,
