  description: `Get payment method

Retrieve a single payment method by its ID.

If a method is not available on this profile, a \`404 Not Found\` response is
returned. If the method is available but not enabled yet, a status \`403 Forbidden\` is returned. You can enable
payments methods via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API, or via
the Mollie Dashboard.

If you do not know the method's ID, you can use the [methods list
endpoint](list-methods) to retrieve all payment methods that are available.

Additionally, it is possible to check if wallet methods such as Apple Pay
are enabled by passing the wallet ID (\`applepay\`) as the method ID.`,
