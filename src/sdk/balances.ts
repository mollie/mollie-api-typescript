   * balance towards this bank account.
   *
   * With the Balances API you can retrieve your current balance. The response
   * includes two amounts:
   *
   * * The *pending amount*. These are payments that have been marked as `paid`,
   * but are not yet available on your balance.
   * * The *available amount*. This is the amount that you can get paid out to
   * your bank account, or use for refunds.
   *
   * With instant payment methods like iDEAL, payments are moved to the available
   * balance instantly. With slower payment methods, like credit card for example, it can take a few days before the
   * funds are available on your balance. These funds will be shown under the *pending amount* in the meanwhile.
