   * Create client link
   *
   * @remarks
   * Link a new or existing organization to your OAuth application, in effect creating a new client. The response contains a `clientLink` where you should redirect your customer to.
   *
   * ## Redirecting the Customer
   *
   * The `clientLink` URL behaves similarly to a standard OAuth authorization URL. Therefore, after receiving the `clientLink` URL in the API response, you need to **append the following query parameters** *before* redirecting the customer:
   *
   * * `client_id` _string (required)_
   *
   *   The client ID you received when you registered your OAuth app. The ID starts with `app_`. For example: `app_abc123qwerty`.
   *
   * * `state` _string (required)_
   *
   *   A random string **generated by your app** to prevent CSRF attacks. This will be reflected in the `state` query parameter when the user returns to the `redirect_uri` after authorizing your app.
   *
   * * `scope` _string (required)_
   *
   *   A space-separated list of permissions ('scopes') your app requires. See the [permissions list](https://docs.mollie.com/docs/connect-permissions) for more information about the available scopes.
   *
   *   We recommend at least : `onboarding.read onboarding.write`
   *
   * * `approval_prompt` _string_
   *
   *   Can be set to `force` to force showing the consent screen to the merchant, *even when it is not necessary*. If you force an approval prompt and the user creates a new authorization, previously active authorizations will be revoked.
   *
   *   Possible values: `auto` `force` (default: `auto`)
   *
   * ### Example of a Complete Redirect URL
   *
   * After adding the above url parameter your URL will look something like this and you can redirect your client to this page:
   *
   * ``` https://my.mollie.com/dashboard/client-link/{id}?client_id={your_client_id}&state={unique_state}&scope=onboarding.read%20onboarding.write ```
   *
   * ## Error Handling
   *
   * Error handling is also dealt with similar to the [Authorize](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/authorize) endpoint: the customer is redirected back to your app's redirect URL with the `error` and `error_description` parameters added to the URL.
