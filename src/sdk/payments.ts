   * implementations start off.

   * Once you have created a payment, you should redirect your customer to the
   * URL in the `_links.checkout` property from the response.
   *
   * To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts
   * can be found in the 'Accepting payments' guide.
   *
   * If you specify the `method` parameter when creating a payment, optional
   * additional parameters may be available for the payment method that are not listed below. Please refer to the
   * guide on [method-specific parameters](extra-payment-parameters).
