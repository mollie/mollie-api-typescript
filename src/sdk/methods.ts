   * For test mode, all pending and enabled payment methods are returned. If no
   * payment methods are requested yet, the most popular payment methods are returned in the test mode. For live
   * mode, only fully enabled payment methods are returned.
   *
   * Payment methods can be requested and enabled via the Mollie Dashboard, or
   * via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API.
   *
   * The list can optionally be filtered using a number of parameters described
   * below.
   *
   * By default, only payment methods for the Euro currency are returned. If you
   * wish to retrieve payment methods which exclusively support other currencies (e.g. Twint), you need to use the
   * `amount` parameters.
   *
   * ℹ️ **Note:** This endpoint only returns **online** payment methods. If you wish to retrieve the information about
   * a non-online payment method, you can use the [Get payment method endpoint](get-method).
