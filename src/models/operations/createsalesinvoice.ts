 *

 * mark it as paid. It can then subsequently be sent as well, same as with `issued`.
 *
 * A status value that cannot be set but can be returned is `canceled`, for invoices which were
 * issued, but then canceled. Currently this can only be done for invoices created in the dashboard.
 *
 * Dependent parameters:
 *   - `paymentDetails` is required if invoice should be set directly to `paid`
 *   - `customerId` and `mandateId` are required if a recurring payment should be used to set the invoice to `paid`
 *   - `emailDetails` optional for `issued` and `paid` to send the invoice by email
